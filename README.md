# DogShow

An app inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's controversial web-app, FaceMash. This adorable game shows you two puppies, and forces you to painfully pick the cutest one!

You can also view the leaderboard, a collection of the top 10 cutest puppies the world picked!

A portion of all profits will go to helping rescue other puppies that need your help.
